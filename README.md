Whats up? I'm Maurice. I'm a software engineer primarily focusing on iOS Development. My experience started by internships at Apple Academy & Tokopedia. Now I help to build and maintain the Alfagift App. My goals is to deliver top of the line app and make contributions to the developer community! 😁
